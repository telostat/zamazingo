# zamazingo

`zamazingo` is a highly opinionated Haskell package that provides some
helper data definitions and functions. It is not yet another prelude.

We strongly advise against using this in a library. It has
dependencies that library authors probably would not want to bloat
their dependency list with.

Until we reach the first major version, there is NO guarantee over the
API. Indeed, expect many changes.
